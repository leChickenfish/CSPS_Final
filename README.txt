This code is significant as it represents a functional and user-friendly audio analysis application developed using Tkinter in Python. The application allows users to load audio files, process them, and visualize key information such as the spectrogram, total time, frequency of greatest amplitude, and RT60 values for specific frequency ranges.

Make sure to have these packages installed on your computer before running this program:
-tkinter 
-numpy
-matplotlib
-soundfile 
-scipy 
Now that all of the packages are installed, we can get into the actaul program itself.
It's pretty self explanitory, all we really have to do is load the audio file by pressing the "load audio" button. Then we have to process the audio by pressing the "process audio" button. Lastly, we just have to plot the audio by pressing its respective button.

This program should work with wav, mp3, and even aac.
